# One-Neuron
My initiative towards training an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Instead of training the entire network, I trained a single neuron or node of the ANN. This approach simplifies the understanding of ANN training mechanisms and allows for deeper insight into the fundamental workings of a single computational unit.
